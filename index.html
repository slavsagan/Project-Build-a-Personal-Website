      <h2>Epic Games’ Bandcamp temporarily wins right to use its own payments system on Google Play</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Epic Games isn’t just fighting the app stores over the right to process its own in-app payments in its popular game Fortnite, it’s also taken up its antitrust legal battle with the tech giants via Bandcamp, the internet music company Epic acquired in March. The following month, Epic filed an injunction asking for the right to allow Bandcamp to continue operating as usual instead of being forced to adopt Google’s own payments system as is now required via a policy change, or risk expulsion from the Google Play Store. On Friday, Bandcamp prevailed on this front, earning the ability to continue to legally operate its existing payment system on Android devices until Epic’s case with Google is resolved, per a new court agreement.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This means Bandcamp’s fans will be able to continue to support their favorite artists on Android devices by buying music and merchandise, as they have since 2015, and artists will receive the same percentage of sales, as usual, Bandcamp said. In addition, Google will not be able to de-list the Bandcamp app from the Google Play Store, nor delay or refuse to distribute its app updates as part of the new agreement.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Bandcamp also said it will now place 10% of the revenue generated by the digital sales on Android devices in escrow until Epic’s lawsuit with Google is decided. At that point, the court will determine whether it or Google will receive those funds based on whether it rules Google’s payments system is anticompetitive.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The 10% figure itself — which represents the commissions Bandcamp would otherwise have to pay Google — is a bit unusual. Google’s typical commissions on in-app purchases range from 15% to 30% for most Google Play developers. But Google offered Bandcamp a reduced fee of 10% in exchange for other concessions, the original court filing revealed. Despite the special offer, Bandcamp argued this was still too much, as it would “force Epic to change Bandcamp’s current business model or else operate the Bandcamp business at a long-term loss,” the filing said.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In a statement published last month to the Bandcamp blog, Bandcamp CEO and co-founder Ethan Diamond further explained that the company would have to “either pass Google’s fees on to consumers (making Android a less attractive platform for music fans), pass fees on to artists (which we would never do), permanently run our Android business at a loss, or turn off digital sales in the Android app,” in order to comply with Google’s new policy changes around in-app purchases.</p>
      <br>
      <p>He also pointed out that Bandcamp had used its own payments system for years, consistent with Google’s prior guidance that exempted digital music from incurring a revenue share.</p>

      <h2>Instagram rolls out a new typeface, slightly-tweaked logo and more in ‘visual refresh’</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Instagram is rolling out a “visual refresh” for its branding this week, the company announced in a blog post on Monday. The company is introducing a slightly-tweaked brighter new logo, typeface and full-screen marketing layouts. Instagram says the new refresh is designed to embrace continued evolution and to help it “create more immersive and inclusive experiences.”</p>
      <br>
      <p>The new typeface is called “Instagram Sans” and was inspired by Instagram’s logo. Instagram notes that the font was inspired by squares and circles, or “squircles.” The new typeface also includes multiple global scripts. The company says Instagram Sans is a contemporary remix of grotesque and geometric styles. Among the new fonts is Instagram Sans Regular, Bold, Light, Medium, Condensed and Condensed Bold.</p>
      <br>
      <p>“Instagram Sans is a new way for our global community to express themselves on Instagram in places like Stories and Reels,” the company said. “While designing this new typeface, our goal was to make Instagram Sans globally accessible. We partnered with language experts around the world to adapt the typeface to global scripts including Arabic, Thai and Japanese. We want to support all of our creators and community members who push culture forward to express themselves fully in any language they choose.”</p>
      <br>
      <p>As for the new logo, the gradient is now a bit more vibrant to make it feel “illuminated and alive,” the company says. Instagram notes that the gradient was reimagined using a 3D modeling process. In terms of the new full-screen marketing layout, Instagram says it’s designed to be “content-forward” and celebrate simplicity.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The launch of the full-screen marketing layouts come as Instagram has been testing a TikTok-like full-screen home feed. The layout impacts the way photos are displayed in the home feed, and history shows that anytime Instagram changes the way posts appear, it causes some controversy. In the test of the full-screen home feed, you can still use the bottom navigation bar to access the discovery tab, Reels, shopping and your own page. The icons to switch accounts, create a post, check your notifications and browse your messages are still on the top bar, too.</p>
